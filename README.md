# Chinese Characters Quiz Game ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

Every Mandarin Chinese learner must memorize the characters that constitute the chinese script, including their meaning and pronunciation.

As I started learning mandarin chinese (with simplified chinese characters), I searched online for some quiz games that could help me memorize the characters. If for the first few HSK levels these quizes are easy to come across, as the level of HSK progresses, they became non-existent. Because of this, I decided to compile every character that I have learned into a single place - separated by level - and make a quiz game out of all the characters.

I started off by web-scraping a large bulk of the characters from a website called [HSK Academy](https://hsk.academy) (which conveniently separates the characters by HSK level) using python. Then I went through the notes I wrote while I was learning, and added the characters that were not present as a result of the web-scraping.

My objective is to keep adding new characters as I continue learning.

If you want to run this project locally, after git cloning the project, you must:

- Option 1)

  - run 'npm install'
  - run 'npm run start:dev'

- Option 2)
  - run 'npm install -g nodemon'
  - run 'nodemon server.js'

After this, go to the specified port in your localhost address (should be port 3000).

Cheers!
